Exploratory tests:
testing one euroal network with and without the hertbeat signal:
  equation: x = (1.0 - dt) * x + J * (tanh(x) * dt) + m * (ft(ti) * dt) + mh * (ht(ti) * dt);
  mh and m were random. 
  linear least square equation : n = pinv((X + sigma * randn(size(X)))') * (ft_ss)'; % decoding weights
